## Project Workflow
Meets Expectations. Readme looks great. I like your goals for this app too, though not sure what a lietner method is.

## Technical Requirements
Meets/Exceeds Expectations. Wow, really great job tyler! Your understanding of the first unit is sound based on your code for this project. Great functionality no huge bugs that I can see from testing it out. Although one of the questions is marked as green on load. I like the level of abstraction you took for your functions consistently leveraging methods you've created throughout your application. Your ready to learn about object oriented design in JS. I would encourage you to read up on it and maybe eventually revamp your entire code base with an object oriented approach.

## Code Quality
Exceeds Expectations. Code is well maintained and separated(although u could put your seed data in a separate file). Most importantly your comments are ON POINT! Maintain that, it's a really great habit.

## Problem Solving
Exceeds expectations. You did a great job putting a creative spin on a normally lackluster problem domain. The complexity of having moving parts and maintaining state is a tricky one, but you did a great job.

## Overall
Really impressed with this code. I enjoyed playing with the application and reading through the code. Let me know if you have any questions/comments/concerns about any/all feedback you've received.
