This project was build using HTML5/CSS3/JS/Jquery

Fundamentally, Flash cards exist to try to memorize something.
They build a cognitive connection between two things - typically a 'term' and it's 'definition'.

Core requirements
- deck of cards with front/back
- flip between front/back
- control using keyboard OR mouse
- mark wether right or wrong
- track which are incorrect, redisplay until right

This project was approached by breaking these core requirements into simple functions and then using these building blocks to create a more complex richer user experience. Users are able to flip between the front/back of cards and see mutiple cards at once.

Advanced Features - Unsolved
- animations
- lietner method
- track scores over time even if page reloaded
- images
- user input for flash cards
